Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with expertise in a variety of programming languages and technologies. With over five years of experience in the industry, I have honed my skills in creating robust and efficient applications. My primary languages include JavaScript, Python, and Java, but I am always eager to explore new languages and frameworks.

I have a solid background in developing web applications using frameworks like React and Node.js, as well as backend technologies such as Express and Django. My experience also extends into mobile app development with React Native and Flutter, allowing me to build seamless applications across platforms.

In my journey as a developer, I have adopted Agile methodologies to ensure that my projects are delivered on time and meet client expectations. I believe that collaboration and open communication are the keys to successful project outcomes. My approach has always been focused on writing clean, maintainable code while staying updated with the latest industry trends.

I am particularly interested in cloud technologies, microservices architecture, and machine learning, which I often incorporate into my projects to enhance functionality and performance. In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen interest in DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines, which have significantly improved my workflow.

Here are some of my pinned repositories that showcase my skills and projects:

- [Project A](https://github.com/kristrunarna677/project-a): A full-stack web application built with React and Node.js.
- [Project B](https://github.com/kristrunarna677/project-b): A mobile application developed using React Native.
- [Project C](https://github.com/kristrunarna677/project-c): An automation script in Python that enhances productivity.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss development topics! Happy coding!
